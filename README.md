# Spheres
A graphics exploration utilizing JavaScript's THREE.js and GLSL's vertex and fragment shaders.

For my creative additions, I searched for additional images to build cube maps. I built the default one for the big sphere I added by myself by cropping a template. I downloaded other ones for the corresponding top, bottom, left, right, near, far faces from github. I added an animation to the big cube and keyboard inputs so that the user can preview backgrounds through the sphere and pick which one they like best by viewing the options using 1,2,3 and applying it with the space bar. I left the default background as background 1 for reference with the reflective sphere I changed in part c.
